
4-Bit Hybrid Carry Lookahead Adder in Verilog

A novel 4-bit adder uses parallel carry computation (lookahead and bit-slice), with a voter at each stage selecting among two local carries and a lookahead carry, providing error resilience via partial triple modular redundancy. The design ensures fast, reliable addition with fault tolerance.
